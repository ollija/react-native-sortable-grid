## Installation

``` npm i react-native-sortable-grid --save ```

## Usage

```
import SortableGrid from 'react-native-sortable-grid'

...

<SortableGrid>
  {
    ['a', 'b', 'c'].map( (letter, index) =>

      <View key={index}>
        <Text>{letter}</Text>
      </View>

    )
  }
</SortableGrid>

```

## SortableGrid properties

 -  ``` style ``` **Object**

  Custom styles to override or complement the sortableGrid native style.

  *  When a row becomes empty of items due to item deletion, the height of the grid is smoothly adjusted to fit the new rows. However, passing ```flex:1``` inside the style prop will cause the grid to fill up the available space and not adjust height when rows become empty.
  * User cannot drag items outside of the grid. Assigning ```flex:1``` will expand the grid, therefore giving more space for the items to be dragged in.
  * When deleting items from the last row on Android, the items can get clipped. You can workaround this by giving the grid ```bottomPadding```. (This is <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.26/docs/known-issues.html#the-overflow-style-property-defaults-to-hidden-and-cannot-be-changed-on-android">a known issue</a> with ```overflow```-property on Android)


 -  ``` blockTransitionDuration ``` **Number**

  How long should the transition of a passive block take when the active block takes its place (milliseconds)

 -  ``` activeBlockCenteringDuration ``` **Number**

  How long should it take for the block that is being dragged to seek its place after it's released  (milliseconds)

 -  ``` itemsPerRow ``` **Number**

  How many items should be placed on one row

 -  ``` itemWidth ``` **Number**

  If set, itemsPerRow will be calculated to fit items of this size

 -  ``` itemHeight ``` **Number**

  When used together with itemsPerRow, sets the size of a block to something other than the default square

 -  ``` dragActivationTreshold ``` **Number**

  How long must the user hold the press on the block until it becomes active and can be dragged (milliseconds)

 -  ``` doubleTapThreshold ``` **Number**

  How long will the execution wait for the second tap before deciding it was a single tap (milliseconds).
  Will be omitted if no onDoubleTap-property is given to the item being tapped - In which case single-tap callback will be executed instantly

 -  ``` onDragStart ``` **Callback** *(activeItem)*

  Function that is called when the dragging starts. This can be used to lock other touch responders from listening to the touch such as ScrollViews and Swipers.

 -  ``` onDragRelease ``` **Callback** *(itemOrder)*

  Function that is executed after the drag is released. Will return the new item order.

 -  ``` onDeleteItem ``` **Callback** *(item)*

  Function that is executed item is deleted. Will return the properties of the deleted item.

 -  ``` dragStartAnimation ``` **Object**

  Custom animation to override the default wiggle. Must be an object containing a key ```transform```, which is an array of transformations. Read about [transforms](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/transforms.html) and [animations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) and [see the example](example/customAnimationExample.js#L47) to learn how to use this.

## SortableGrid methods

 -  ``` toggleDeleteMode ``` accepts no arguments

  Calling this will toggle item deletion mode on/off. Will return object ```{ deleteModeOn: true/false }```.


## SortableGrid's children's properties

 -  ``` onTap ``` **Callback**

  Function that is executed when the block is tapped once, but not pressed for long enough to activate the drag.

 -  ``` onDoubleTap ``` **Callback**

  Function that is executed when the block is double tapped within a timeframe of ```doubleTapTreshold``` (default 150ms). Assigning this will delay the execution of ```onTap```. Omitting this will cause all taps to be handled as single taps, regardless of their frequency.

 - ``` inactive ``` **Boolean**

Flag to mark a child node as being inactive. If set, no touch events will be fired when users interact with the node.

## onDragRelease return value looks like this:

```
Object {

  itemOrder: Array [
    0: Object {
      key: "1"
      order: 0
      ref: null
    }
    1: Object {
      key: "5"
      order: 1
      ref: null
    }
    n: Object ...
  ]

}
```

## Full SortableGrid example:

```
 <SortableGrid
   blockTransitionDuration      = { 400 }
   activeBlockCenteringDuration = { 200 }
   itemsPerRow                  = { 4 }
   dragActivationTreshold       = { 200 }
   onDragRelease                = { (itemOrder) => console.log("Drag was released, the blocks are in the following order: ", itemOrder) }
   onDragStart                  = { ()          => console.log("Some block is being dragged now!") } >

   {
     ['a', 'b', 'c'].map( (letter, index) =>

       <View key={index} onTap={() => console.log("Item number:", index, "was tapped!") }>
         <Text>{letter}</Text>
       </View>

     )
   }

 </SortableGrid>

```
